# Passowrd Generator

This project will teach you how to generate random passwords. Start by initiating the process of creating a random password. Next, make it a robust and secure one. That is, generate a strong password. Ensure that the strong password is a mix of lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers and punctuation marks. Additionally, you might want to check some online password generation tools for inspiration. 

**Bonus**:
You can ask a user to input a password to register for a website and you could check if the password is strong by checking for punctuations, numerics and lowercase or uppercase characters. If true, you register the user.
To even have more fun you can go ahead and create a password generator that saves a user's password automatically. Think of Google password manager, Bitwarden or an internet security software like Kaspersky. You can think of this project as an opportunity to replicate that functionality.

## Skills you will learn:
- Working with strings
- user input validation
